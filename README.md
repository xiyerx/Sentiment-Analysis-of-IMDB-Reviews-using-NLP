Natural language processing refers to the field of artificial intelligence that deals with the
creation of computational models that give computers the ability to process and understand
natural language in the same way humans do. Natural language processing is a combination
of computational linguistics, statistical models, machine learning and deep learning. These
technologies allow computers to process text or voice data and understand its meaning, along
with its intent and sentiment. The main goal of NLP is to make computers understand complex
human language so that they can help humans with various language-related tasks. NLP
techniques are used in many applications like machine translation, search engines, text
summarization, sentiment analysis, question answering, etc.

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the field of study that involves
interpreting and classifying peopleâ€™s opinions, sentiments, and emotions from text using text
analysis techniques. It is implemented by using a combination of natural language processing
and statistics. Sentiment analysis mainly deals with the evaluation of opinions into positive,
negative or neutral categories. This output is based on dependencies that are captured by word
n-grams, TF-IDF features, or deep learning models.
Sentiment analysis allows organizations to identify public sentiment towards entities such as
products, services, issues, events or topics. It is most commonly used in social media
analysis to discover consumer insights or to identify signs of mental illness. Companies and
organizations can then use this information to develop better products and campaigns. In this
project, sentiment analysis was performed on IMDB reviews to understand the overall opinion
of movies and television shows.
