# Sentiment-Analysis-of-IMDB-Reviews-using-NLP
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the field of study that involves
interpreting and classifying peopleâ€™s opinions, sentiments, and emotions from text using text
analysis techniques. It is implemented by using a combination of natural language processing
and statistics. Sentiment analysis mainly deals with the evaluation of opinions into positive,
negative or neutral categories. This output is based on dependencies that are captured by word
n-grams, TF-IDF features, or deep learning models.
Sentiment analysis allows organizations to identify public sentiment towards entities such as
products, services, issues, events or topics. It is most commonly used in social media
analysis to discover consumer insights or to identify signs of mental illness. Companies and
organizations can then use this information to develop better products and campaigns. In this
project, sentiment analysis was performed on IMDB reviews to understand the overall opinion
of movies and television shows.
